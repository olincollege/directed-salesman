Exploration of solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem with directed graphs


### Relevant Files
`held_karp.py`, `nearest_neighbor.py`, `brute_force.py` and `branch_and_bound.py` are the files holding the relevant code for each algorithm. Some of those reference helper files (`branch_helpers.py`, `bitset.py`, etc). `utils.py` and `alg_test.py` provide basic graph and testing functionality. `nearest_neighbor.ipynb` contains algorithmic descriptions, time complexity calculations and tests on different graph types. `algorithm_complexity.ipynb` goes over proofs of time complexity for some of the algorithms. `bibliography.txt` cites and describes the use of all relevant sources.
